# Problem
* I forget people's name
* I forget people's birthday
* I forget people's address
* I forget where i know people from
* I forget who knows who

# Solution

A peace of software that stores everybody that I know and the connection between them, 
other people that I know and me.
The system should notify me via a channel ( to be decided (eg: 
email, 
discord message, 
app that is installed , 
post notification) ). 


The software only has 1 user for now and that is me but it should be able to have more users in the future.

The software must be secured using a username and password because were handeling private information.
